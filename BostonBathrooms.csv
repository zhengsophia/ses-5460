These could get a 1 entirely on the basis of their smell - in particular, the men's room door was open, wafting its odor across the whole mezzanine. The women's room was just as bad. Combine it with incredibly depressing aesthetics and missing amenities (the women's room had no paper towels, while the men's room lacked paper towels, soap, and even the mirror), and these are some awful bathrooms.\r\nSource: www.milesintransit.com/2019/09/01/the-unofficial-mbta-bathroom-map/"
